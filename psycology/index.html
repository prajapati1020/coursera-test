<h1 style="color:chartreuse;">Decisions I made to create a positive social impression</h1>

<h2>I found my context</h2>

<div>It’s important to first consider where I am trying to make a good impression—whether it’s a
    formal job interview or a dinner date.</div>
<div> The reason is simple: context matters. It gives me cues as
to how you should dress, look and behave.</div>

<h2>I adjusted my attitude</h2>

<div>If you’re having a good day, you probably look happy and people might be more likely to form a
    positive impression of you.</div>
    <div> Alternatively, if you’re having a bad day, you might appear
unapproachable. So, I was precocious.</div>

<h2>I searched for a common ground</h2>

<div>People who have an easy time connecting with others often find common ground with someone
    else in just a few seconds.</div>
    <div> That’s a major decision I made because when everyone likes it when
they have something common with others.</div>

<h2>I shifted the focus from myself to others</h2>

<div>In new situations, we tend to notice how we’re feeling instead of how others are feeling. But
    experts say we should pay more attention to those around us.</div>
    <div> People always remember how
you made them feel. And that is why I had a focus on people around me as well.</div>

<h2>Being myself</h2>

        <div>In order to make a good first impression, it’s important to be genuine.</div>
        <div> If I am constantly worried
about whether or not I am doing or saying the right thing, I could appear insincere or too
strategic. So, I tried to be just myself.</div>

<h2>I had a good sleep</h2>

<div>When I am sleep-deprived, I appear different. The skin is much paler, which is often a signal for
    sickness; </div>
    <div>I have shadows under the eyes; the corners of the mouth are slightly turned
downward. So, I made sure that I am having a minimum of 7 hours sleep.</div>
